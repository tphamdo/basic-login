# Basic Login

This is a very basic server that can be used as a starter template for various websites needing user authentication. It handles login authentication (with username and password) and persistent sessions. The tech stack includes Node.js, Typescript, Express, EJS, Passport.js, and Prisma. The authentication strategy can be swapped out using a different [Passport strategy](https://www.passportjs.org/packages/). This will likely require changes to the User table under the Prisma schema. The environment variables `DATABASE_URL` and `SECRET_SESSION` will need to be set. The implementation has only been tested using PostgreSQL but will probably work with other relational databases. Some slight modification to the prisma schema will also probably allow the implementation to work with MongoDB.
